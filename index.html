          <li class="info">
            <strong>1969</strong> - The following October, <i>Nottingham Forest</i> wanted to sign Ferguson,but his wife was not keen on moving to England at that time, so he went to <i>Falkirk</i> instead.

        <p>“As a manager he was the best but his man-management was something which a lot of other managers would struggle to match. He knew how to speak to players, how to get a reaction. He’s the only manager that could leave someone out and make them feel good about it – he was incredible.”</p>
